            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Declan, known online as Spectrum, a university student from <a href="https://www.glos.ac.uk/" class="paragraphlink">University of Gloucestershire</a> expecting to graduate in November of this year with a bachelors degree in Games Programming.<br>
                I'm actively looking for work, so if you think I may be a good fit please do get in contact!<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had experience working both along and in teams in a selection of languages and software mainstream in the industry, including most notably, but not limited to, C# and GDScript in Unity and Godot respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is still a pretty heavy work-in-progress, so I appreciate your patience while I get everything set up between other temporary work.<br>
