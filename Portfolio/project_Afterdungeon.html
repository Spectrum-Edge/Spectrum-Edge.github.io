            <h1>Afterdungeon Level Generator</h1>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>
                This project is a Work-In-Progress collaboration between myself and SkyTheFloof, intended to be an infinite, first-person PvE game. Players are tasked with exploring an endless series of randomly-generated rooms filled with enemies, some of which must be defeated to progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became a part of this project when I offered to assist Sky with the random level generation, after advising her on how she might have created it herself before we decided to collaborate. Below is a video in which you can see the level generating using the system I created.

                Below is a video showing the generation system off. The "Generation buffer" ahead of the player's current room is increased dramatically in order to do this.
                <br>The video uses a single test room, with 3 doorways inside, as the only generated main room to show off how the generation works in real time. During normal gameplay, rooms will be distinct, and generation will only occur a few rooms ahead of where the players currently are.
                <ul style="text-align:left">
                    <li>When the player's character is placed in the first room, the system updates and finds it needs to generate many rooms ahead, due to the desired generation buffer size.</li>
                    <li>The system generates a random room from the currently specified generation set, which can be modified anytime to be a folder of room prefabs, or a specific single room prefab.</li>
                    <li>The system then places side rooms in the previous room if any doors are left unused. There is a modifiable chance that a side room does not attempt to generate</li>
                    <li>Any time generation of a main path room fails due to detecting overlap with another room, the ill-fitting room is removed, potentially along with several prior rooms, if there have been consecutive failures to create the next main path room</li>
                    <li>Any unused doors, either due to being specified by a doorway's attributes as unused, or because a sideroom could not fit in the area behind it, become replaced by one of a blockade prefab set, which is modifiable at any time.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                My level generation system features the ability to generate a variable number of rooms ahead of a player's progress, with the capability to backtrack during generation to escape from dead-ends. Specific room numbers along the main path can be easily dedicated to a specific room type, as well as siderooms, secrets, and multiple room entrances/exits per room being supported.
                <br>The current room each player is in is also tracked, with the player characters reacting to entering the bounding boxes of each room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Afterdungeon is still a Work-In-Progress due to both of us spending much of our time with other projects and obligations, but we are both looking forward to getting the game into a ready-to-play state.
