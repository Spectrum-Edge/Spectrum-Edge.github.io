            <h2>A peaceful promenade</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a small experiment showing some relatively simple shaders I created using GLSL in Godot to create a small scene.

            <p>
                Originally this project was created to be submitted for an assignment for university, however I've occasionally returned to it since it's quite a therapeutic project to work on. It still has a long way to go before I'll stop adding to it, I just wish I had more time for it among my other responsibilities and projects.

                The scene features a small variety of shaders. Between all of them, there is usage of uniforms, extensive use of perlin noise maps, application of screen-space rendering, and vertex manipulation and fragment coloring based on position and timing.<br>
                I would honestly love to work on a similar project but invest much more time into making the visuals truly stunning.
