            <p>
                I've been slowly chipping away at putting together this website since my studies at university concluded. I had another portfolio website before, but I wasn't as fond of it, needed to update it, and felt like it was a good excuse to brush up on HTML since it had been a long time since I last tried using it.<br>
                There's still a LOT I would like to do with this site, but right now getting myself "out there" is pretty high up on my priority list because of a few factors. Sorry if it's not quite as polished as you may have expected.

                Since this is the main repository of my personal account, I may also use this site for other things in the future, instead of it <i>just</i> being for my portfolio. I think it would be nice to have the site be woven into more of the things I actively do and engage with. There's so much I want to do at the moment, and so little time to work on it.
